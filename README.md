Orbital Project 2024 by Team FMok

We aim to provide a reliable platform for students to organize their tasks and responsibilities effectively. By offering an interactive to-do list, we aim to empower students to take control of their schedules and prioritize tasks based on importance. This not only helps in better time management but also facilitates informed decision-making, ultimately leading to increased productivity and a sense of accomplishment.

Through the incorporation of gamification elements, we aim to transform the way students engage with their responsibilities. By introducing game-like features and rewards, we seek to incentivize timely task completion and foster a proactive attitude towards academic and personal commitments. By achieving these goals, we aspire to create a tool that not only enhances productivity and reduces procrastination, but also promotes a healthy and balanced approach to student life.
